# sauce_demo_selenium_cucumber
## Overview

This project is a test automation framework designed to validate the functionality of the [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website. It primarily focuses on testing the shopping functionality using Selenium WebDriver, Java, JUnit, and Cucumber.

## Features Tested

- **Shop Page Functionality**:
    - Verification of product details (title, description, price, and image) consistency before and after a page refresh.
    - Ensuring correct product information is displayed on the product detail page.
    - Adding products to the cart and verifying cart contents.
    - Ensuring product details remain consistent in the cart.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Java**: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation and interacting with web elements.
- **JUnit**: Framework for writing and running unit tests.
- **Cucumber**: For behavior-driven development (BDD), allowing tests to be written in Gherkin syntax.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **Gherkin** to define and execute test scenarios.

## What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is a language used to write structured tests called **features**. Gherkin syntax is simple, human-readable, and allows you to describe software behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented.

## How to Write a Gherkin Scenario

A typical Gherkin scenario follows this structure:


### Example
Here’s an example of a Gherkin scenario for a login feature:

gherkin
    Code kopieren
    Feature: User login As a user, I want to log into my account so that I can access my dashboard.
```gherkin
        Scenario: Successful login
            Given the user is on the login page
            When the user enters valid credentials
            Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
    
        Scenario: Failed login
             Given the user is on the login page
             When the user enters invalid credentials
             Then an error message is displayed

```

### Writing Step Definitions
For each Gherkin step, there should be a corresponding step definition in your Java code. Example:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class LoginSteps {

    @Given("the user is on the login page")
    public void theUserIsOnTheLoginPage() {
        // Code to navigate to the login page
    }

    @When("the user enters valid credentials")
    public void theUserEntersValidCredentials() {
        // Code to enter valid credentials
    }

    @Then("the user is redirected to the dashboard")
    public void theUserIsRedirectedToTheDashboard() {
        // Code to verify the user is on the dashboard
    }
}
```

### Key Components

- **Page Object Models (POM)**: Encapsulates web elements and interactions for each page, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Step Definitions**: Maps Gherkin steps in the feature files to Java methods.
- **Utility Classes**: Provides reusable methods for common actions like waiting for elements, capturing texts, and handling browser interactions.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+
- Maven 3+
- Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver compatible with the installed Chrome version

## How to Run the Tests

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
   mvn clean install
4. To execute the tests, run:
 
    ```bash
    mvn test

## Writing Tests
### Adding New Features

1. Create a new feature file in src/test/resources/features/.
2. Define the scenarios in Gherkin syntax.
3. Implement the corresponding step definitions in src/test/java/sauce_demo/steps/.

### Reporting

Cucumber generates test reports in  *target/cucumber-reports.* You can also integrate with reporting tools like Allure for enhanced test reports.

```bash
cd target/surefire-reports

```
###  Future Enhancements
- Integration with a CI/CD pipeline for automated test execution.
- Adding more test scenarios for edge cases and additional functionalities.
- Cross-browser testing support.
